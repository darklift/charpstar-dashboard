// Default CVR = (Total amount of people who have purchased the product / page_view event count) * 100
// ga_session_id can be used to identity users.
// Conversion Rate with CharpstAR clicks = (Total Purchases of the "Trip" Product after the user has clicked the AR/3D Button / Total times any of the two buttons were clicked) * 100
// Total times any of the two buttons were clicked - This we already have ready
// Total Purchases of the "Trip" Product after the user has clicked the AR/3D Button - This we need to look at the users who have made the purchases and see if they have interacted with either AR or 3D buttons. But I'm not sure if you have the capability of doing that from the BigQuery data

// - Get purchases list.
// - Check if the purchase had an AR button click a week before by the same user id
